This serves as a repository for the steps taken for setting up the virtual machines used in my research.
The files present have the cmd line command used to setup thing like OpenVPN, Wireguard, and OpenSSH.
Additionally, included is the cmd line information used for Wireshark testing.

Each file is named for the VM it represents. Please open to read overviews for the Server and Client Virtual Machines.
