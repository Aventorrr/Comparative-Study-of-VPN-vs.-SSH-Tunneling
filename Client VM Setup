#Open VirutalBox, create an Ubantu 64-bit VM. Ensure that the VM has 4 vCPUs and 12 GB of RAM. In the Network Settings, select NAT for Adapter 1 and Host-Only Adapter for Adapter 2.
#Once in VM, run: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
#Make sure netowrk adapters show by running: ip addr show
#Install used programs by running: sudo apt install openssh-server openvpn easy-rsa wireguard iperf3 wireshark cmstat -y

#OpenSSH
#For the Client, 

#WireGuard
#Generate Client key: "umask 077" and "wg genkey | tee ~wg_private | wg pubkey > ~/wg_public"
#Once generated, show the key to paste in Server: echo "PRIVATE:"; cat ~/wg_private; echo "PUBLIC:"; cat ~/wg_public
#Run: "sudo mkdir -p /etc/wireguard" and "sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf"
#Inside the config file, the following info will be entered:
  #[Interface]
  #Address=10.6.0.2/24
  #PrivateKey=(Client Private Key)
  #[Peer]
  #PublicKey=(Server Public Key)
  #AllowdIPs=10.6.0.1/32
  #Endpoint=(IPAddress):51820
  #PersistentKeepalive=15
#Once the config file is saved, run: sudo wg-quick up wg0
#Ping the server to make sure the tunnel is working
#Once tunnel is confirmed to be working, run: iperf3 -c 10.6.0.1 -B 10.6.0.2
#Shutdown the tunnel once the testing in finished: sudo wg-quick down wg0
